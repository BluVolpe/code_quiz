# Coding Quiz

  
  
## Description
A timed/scored quiz on the basics of coding (HTML, CSS, & JavaScript). Press the "start quiz" button to begin and a series of questions will be presented one by one with multiple choice answers. Each wrong answer will remove 10 seconds from the timer with the left over time being the final score.
